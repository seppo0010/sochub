# Privacy Policy

Privacy is cool! So we don't really want to collect any information about you,
to be honest. We are relying on Trello to store your personal data, and all
your access tokens. We don't monitor the traffic, we don't store information,
we don't share the information. We do publish to your linked accounts or import
information from the sources you select, but that's it. We do not have
analytics of any kind besides the ones provided by the platforms like Trello.
We don't have cookies of our own, only for the linked services. We always use
HTTPS to transfer information. Our server is in Google Cloud Platform, in the
United States.

Since we don't really collect user data we really cannot let you know if we
change this, as we don't know you are using it. If you want to receive an email
if we change this, please fill [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfX1K7q378FaY0wJ2Fw-wrJWVYvAzfgrTrSMWbK9pEfPG5W1Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Data we have to store

### Telegram

If you set a telegram account as default preview we do have to store its
information as we cannot retrieve it later otherwise. We create an id based
on your access token so any attacker would have to guess that to see your avatar
which is most likely public, so it isn't much.

### Canva

For Canva integration we have to store some secret information about the user
to validate the requests that are coming from their servers.

## Contact

If you want to contact us, feel free to open an issue on github or send us an
email to seppo0010@gmail.com.
